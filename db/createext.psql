-- During seeding (http://localhost:3000/seed), it would encounter an error creating extension for
-- "uuid-ossp" (duplicate entry). I suspect it's a race condition given async nature.
-- Rerunning seeding would succeed. As a workaround, I move it to right after db creation.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
